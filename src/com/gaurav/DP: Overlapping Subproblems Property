Overlapping Subproblems Property in Dynamic Programming | DP-1
Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems
and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again. Following are the two main properties
of a problem that suggests that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming.

In this post, we will discuss first property (Overlapping Subproblems) in detail. The second property of Dynamic
programming is discussed in next post i.e. Set 2.

1) Overlapping Subproblems
2) Optimal Substructure

1) Overlapping Subproblems:
Like Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming combines solutions to sub-problems. Dynamic Programming is mainly used
when solutions of same subproblems are needed again and again. In dynamic programming, computed solutions to
subproblems are stored in a table so that these don’t have to be recomputed. So Dynamic Programming is not useful
when there are no common (overlapping) subproblems because there is no point storing the solutions if they are not
needed again. For example, Binary Search doesn’t have common subproblems. If we take an example of following recursive
program for Fibonacci Numbers, there are many subproblems which are solved again and again.


/* simple recursive program for Fibonacci numbers */
int fib(int n)
{
   if ( n <= 1 )
      return n;
   return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
Recursion tree for execution of fib(5)






                         fib(5)
                     /             \
               fib(4)                fib(3)
             /      \                /     \
         fib(3)      fib(2)         fib(2)    fib(1)
        /     \        /    \       /    \
  fib(2)   fib(1)  fib(1) fib(0) fib(1) fib(0)
  /    \
fib(1) fib(0)
We can see that the function fib(3) is being called 2 times. If we would have stored the value of fib(3), then
instead of computing it again, we could have reused the old stored value. There are following two different ways
to store the values so that these values can be reused:
a) Memoization (Top Down)
b) Tabulation (Bottom Up)

a) Memoization (Top Down): The memoized program for a problem is similar to the recursive version with a small
modification that it looks into a lookup table before computing solutions. We initialize a lookup array with all
initial values as NIL. Whenever we need the solution to a subproblem, we first look into the lookup table. If the
precomputed value is there then we return that value, otherwise, we calculate the value and put the result in the
lookup table so that it can be reused later.



/* Java program for Memoized version */
public class Fibonacci
{
  final int MAX = 100;
  final int NIL = -1;

  int lookup[] = new int[MAX];

  /* Function to initialize NIL values in lookup table */
  void _initialize()
  {
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX; i++)
        lookup[i] = NIL;
  }

  /* function for nth Fibonacci number */
  int fib(int n)
  {
    if (lookup[n] == NIL)
    {
      if (n <= 1)
          lookup[n] = n;
      else
          lookup[n] = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
    }
    return lookup[n];
  }

  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Fibonacci f = new Fibonacci();
    int n = 40;
    f._initialize();
    System.out.println("Fibonacci number is" + " " + f.fib(n));
  }
}




b) Tabulation (Bottom Up): The tabulated program for a given problem builds a table in bottom up fashion and
returns the last entry from table. For example, for the same Fibonacci number, we first calculate fib(0) then
fib(1) then fib(2) then fib(3) and so on. So literally, we are building the solutions of subproblems bottom-up.

Following is the tabulated version for nth Fibonacci Number.

/* Java program for Tabulated version */
public class Fibonacci
{
  int fib(int n)
  {
    int f[] = new int[n+1];
    f[0] = 0;
    f[1] = 1;
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
          f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2];
    return f[n];
  }

  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Fibonacci f = new Fibonacci();
    int n = 9;
    System.out.println("Fibonacci number is" + " " + f.fib(n));
  }

}


Output:
 Fibonacci number is 34
Both Tabulated and Memoized store the solutions of subproblems. In Memoized version, table is filled on demand
while in Tabulated version, starting from the first entry, all entries are filled one by one. Unlike the Tabulated
version, all entries of the lookup table are not necessarily filled in Memoized version. For example, Memoized
solution of the LCS problem doesn’t necessarily fill all entries.


Time taken by Recursion method is much more than the two Dynamic Programming techniques mentioned above – Memoization
and Tabulation!
